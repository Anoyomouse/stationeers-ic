# Stationeers IC Simulator

An implementation of the suggested [Stationeers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/544550/Stationeers/) IC system suggested by [Recatek on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stationeers/comments/8wfi98/the_pain_of_logic_and_the_potential_of_integrated/) which Rocket was enthusiastic about.

This will be updated once the offical implementation is in place. This was developed for a feature on [stationeering.com](https://stationeering.com).

## Test

```
npm install
npm test
```

You may need to globally install eslint depending on your npm environment.
